# Patchus Maximus in zEdit
Patchus Maximus has in the past, been one of my more preferred perk and gameplay mods.
For a number of reasons, not least of which that its conversion to Special Edition hasn't been
fully functional as of this writing, other mods such as Ordinator have supplanted it as my
overhauls of choice. However, given the wide-reaching nature of this overhaul and its opportunity
to provide enjoyment to many other individuals it certainly deserves a good update.
